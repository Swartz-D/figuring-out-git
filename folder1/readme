must commit all changes in a branch before switching branches
-go to github
-approve pull request
-delete feature branch on 
--feature branch deleted in github but still showing up when git branch -r
--feature branch will always be visible when doing git branch -r even when it has been deleted
making a new change here to try to commit to main while main has been changed but i have not pulled it back down

making some changes on this new branch
will commit and push
(push is not necessary for successful merge however this is good practice for group work so team can see and review changes before merge)
then switch to main and merge then delete feature branch

making some changes in main then will merge with branch

now in awesome branch, will commit then push then create a new feature off this branch 

adding from feature of feature

changes to feature
